# MPG Tracker

- Built for myself and others that like to check their mpg's after a gas tank fill up and added a log to save your trip along with a bar graph to give a visual of the mpg data. Uses local storage to keep your mpg data current on the bar graph.

- Uses React.js, React Hooks, react-chartjs-2, and Parcel.js
